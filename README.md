## In Chapter 1 we have mentioned the data types int and String. Java has more predefined data types. Find out what they are and what they are used for. To do this, you can check Appendix B, or look it up in another Java book or in an online Java language manual. One such manual is at [http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/datatypes.html](http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/datatypes.html)

## What are the types of the following values?

* 0 - integer
* "hello" - String
* 101 - integer
* -1 - integer
* true - boolean expression
* "33" - String
* 3.1415 - integer

## What would you have to do to add a new field, for example one called name, to a circle object?

private int name

## Write the header for a method named send that has one parameter of type String, and does not return a value.

public void send(String msg)

## Write the header for a method named average that has two parameters, both of type int, and returns an int value.

public int average(int num1, int num2)

## Look at the book you are reading right now. Is it an object or a class? If it is a class, name some objects. If it is an object, name its class.

Object, Class: Book

## Can an object have several different classes? Discuss.

No, an object can only be one type
